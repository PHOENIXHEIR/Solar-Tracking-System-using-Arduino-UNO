# Solar-Tracking-System-using-Arduino-UNO

# Description - 
A solar tracking system using an Arduino UNO is a system that tracks the position of the sun and adjusts the angle of a solar panel to ensure it is always facing the sun directly. The Arduino UNO is a microcontroller board that is commonly used in electronic projects due to its ease of use and flexibility.

The solar tracking system typically consists of light sensors, a motor, and an Arduino UNO. The light sensors are used to detect the position of the sun and send data to the Arduino UNO. The Arduino UNO then processes this data and sends signals to the motor to adjust the angle of the solar panel.

The system can be programmed to track the sunâ€™s movement throughout the day and adjust the solar panel accordingly. This allows the solar panel to capture the maximum amount of solar energy, which can be used to power various electronic devices or stored in a battery for later use.

Overall, a solar tracking system using an Arduino UNO is an efficient and cost-effective way to improve the performance of solar panels and increase their energy output.

# Components 
Light sensors: Light sensors, such as photodiodes or phototransistors, are used to detect the position of the sun. These sensors are cost-effective, easy to use, and can provide accurate readings of light intensity.

Motor: The motor is used to adjust the angle of the solar panel based on the readings from the light sensors. A stepper motor is often used because it allows precise control over the angle of the panel.

Arduino UNO: The Arduino UNO is a popular microcontroller board that is easy to program and can interface with various sensors and components. It is a cost-effective and flexible option for controlling the solar tracking system.

Breadboard and jumper wires: These components are used to connect the light sensors, motor, and Arduino UNO together. A breadboard allows for easy and temporary prototyping, while jumper wires provide a convenient way to make connections between components.
